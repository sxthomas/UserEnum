# UserEnum
User account enumeration of web applications

This tool makes multiple login attempts with a known bad username followed by multiple login attempts with a a list of usernames.  Some web applications check for the presence of a user account before checking the password.  This leads to a noticeable time delta between attempts with a good username verses a bad username.
